# Azure Cognitive Services for Language
A repo to consolidate a number of helpful scripts to experiment with Azure Cognitive Services for language.
- For text analytics, focusing on only five capabilities: sentiment, PII, key phrases, entity recognition and
summarization. For each capability, have a default sample, but can also add free text, and/or use the default
file with a number of statements.
- For the ingestion client, refer the following guide: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/samples/ingestion/ingestion-client/Setup/guide.md)
- Custom text classification example: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples/sample_multi_label_classify.py
